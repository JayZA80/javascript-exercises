(Add)
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments (x and y)
Return x + y

(Subtract)
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments (x and y)
Return x - y

(Sum of more than 2 numbers)
Write a function that takes a list as an argument
Use an iterative function that keeps track of a total and the current value
Add the current value to the total
Return the result

(Power/Exponent)
Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments (x to be affected, y to raise the power by)
Loop y times
In each iteration, multiply x by itself
Return the final number

(Factorial)
Write a function that takes one number as an argument (x)
Create a list and put x in the list
Keep track of the current number, starting with x
While the current number is greater than 1
Add the current number to the list
Reduce the current number by 1
Use an iterative function that keeps track of a total and the current value on the list
Multiply the total and the current value
Return the result
